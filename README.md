# Arduino_Pd

Arduino_Pd

This repository is a set of Pd abstractions (both vanilla and extended) and Arduino code that facilitates the communication between the two platforms.

[serial_print] (and its extended counterpart [serial_print_extended]) works with the Serial.print() and Serial.println() functions of the Arduino.

[serial_write] works with the Serial.write() function of the Arduino.

Check their help patches and Arduino code for more information.
